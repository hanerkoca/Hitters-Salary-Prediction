#### Description: We have some baseball players with their season '86 and also career statistics. And the most important data for the dataset, Salary is from Sports Illustrated. Steps are gonna be like this: Firstly, we check the dataset if there is missing values or some outliers. And then we create some features. Modelling part is gonna be with Linear Regression and we get the Test, Train scores. At the end with our Model we try to predict salaries from baseball players, that they have no information about their salaries.
